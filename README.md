# hackuci2021
 
I rolled ideas from HackUCI's starter packs and got something about making a mobile app about Pokemon TCG. I tried to make an Android App but Android Studio and Java are too much of a hassle to deal with in under a day. So I just made a Python program that builds search requests to the Pokemon TCG API, though it doesn't work as intended. I could fix and build off of this later to create a card searching / deck building webpage but I'll leave it for now.
